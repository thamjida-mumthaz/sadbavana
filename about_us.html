             <ul style="margin-left:15px">
             <li>To become a global player in empowering educational institutions.</li>
			<li>To provide quality standards in teaching and learning by generating best practices to enhance academic excellence.</li>
			<li>To engage student populace for their holistic development.</li>
             </ul>
             </h6>
             <h6 class="h62">Founded in 2005, Sadhbhavana took birth from a desire for excellence. Having realized the importance of education and its transformative potential, a group of individuals began to ponder about the unsatisfactory standards of quality in the education sector. Hailing from diverse business backgrounds ranging from finance to logistics, the group decided to set up a school with a difference one that would challenge the status quo and set the benchmark for other institutions. Researching on what marks the difference between a good school and a great school, the team arrived at a qualitative framework for achieving excellence in the education domain. To realize their vision, in 2008, the group first established Sadhbhavana World School on a sprawling 56 acre campus developed into an integrated township. But this was not enough for the group. They wanted to become the go-to place for everything that was educational. As such Sadhbhavana Group was set up in 2012.</h6>
             <h6 class="h62">The team behind Sadhbhavana strongly believes that the purpose of a progressive education is to reflect on human life and social relationships, realize the fullness of human existence, cultivate critical, creative and courageous thinking, to be socially responsible and make compassionate connections, to value the nation's and the world's social, moral and spiritual well-being.</h6>
             <h6 class="h62">Sadhbhavana's perspective of a great school is one that continually fosters to develop students who are emotionally intelligent, intellectually proficient, professionally competent, value oriented world citizens. It would be a place where dramatics is as important as Algebra, where trekking goes hand in hand with Botany and where the 21st century learning skills are an essential part of everyday learning. There the fertile mind would be encouraged and young minds cultivated to think and act independently. A child going into such a school would come out as tomorrow's beacon of hope, leader par excellence. With this firm belief Sadhbhavana strives daily in achieving excellence in all the areas of education and related services. Exemplifying its vision, Sadhbhavana has been a personification of professionalism and quality consciousness. To stay at the top, one has to evolve continuously. The group takes pride in its research-orientated approach and strives to be a learning organization that pioneers positive change in the society. The group is committed to observing the highest standard of ethical code and corporate governance when it comes to running its business.</h6>
